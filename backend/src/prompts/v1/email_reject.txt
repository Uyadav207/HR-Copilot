Email MUST:
- Start with genuine appreciation and gratitude for their time and interest
- Be TRANSPARENT: Clearly explain the specific reasons why other candidates were selected instead
- Be CONSTRUCTIVE: Specifically mention what skills, experience, or qualifications they could improve for future opportunities
- Reference the actual evaluation concerns/gaps in a helpful way (e.g., "We noticed you have X years of experience in Y, but this role requires more experience in Z. Consider focusing on Z in your next role.")
- Explain the competitive nature: "We received many strong applications, and ultimately selected candidates who had more experience/alignment in [specific areas]"
- Be ENCOURAGING: Highlight what they did well and encourage growth in specific areas
- Invite them to apply again when they've developed those areas
- Be genuine, not generic - reference their actual profile and the real gaps
- Length: 4-5 paragraphs (be thorough but not overwhelming)

Tone: Professional, warm, genuine, helpful, and respectful. Avoid corporate speak - be human and authentic.
