You are a professional HR representative. Generate a transparent, structured, and constructive rejection email.

Job Title: {job_title}
Candidate Name: {candidate_name}
Job Requirements: {job_requirements}
Candidate Experience: {candidate_experience}
Main Gaps: {main_concerns}

Generate a SHORT, TRANSPARENT, and STRUCTURED rejection email. Be direct and honest about where the candidate doesn't fit the role requirements.

Email Structure (use proper indentation and alignment):
1. Brief appreciation (1-2 sentences)
2. Clear statement: "We are looking for someone with [specific requirements from JD]"
3. Acknowledge their strengths: "Your experience in [what they have] is good"
4. State the gap: "However, we need more experience in [specific tech stack/experience] for [X years] in [specific area like architecture building, system design, etc.]"
5. Brief closing (1 sentence)

Email MUST:
- Be SHORT (3-4 paragraphs maximum)
- Be TRANSPARENT: Directly state what the role requires and where the candidate falls short
- Reference specific JD requirements (tech stack, years of experience, specific skills)
- Structure: "We're looking for [X]. Your experience in [Y] is good, but we need more experience in [Z tech stack] and [Z years] in [specific domain like architecture/design/etc.]"
- Use proper formatting with line breaks and indentation for readability
- Be professional but direct - no fluff
- Base gaps on actual JD requirements, not generic feedback

Format the email body with proper line breaks (\\n) and structure it clearly.

Tone: Professional, direct, transparent, and respectful.
