You are an expert HR analyst. Your task is to parse a job description and extract structured information into a JSON blueprint.

Job Description:
{job_description}

Extract the following information and return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no code blocks):

1. role_title: The exact job title
2. department: Department or team name (if mentioned)
3. seniority_level: junior, mid, senior, lead, or principal (infer if not explicit)
4. required_skills: Array of objects with:
   - skill: Name of the skill/technology
   - priority: "must_have" or "nice_to_have"
   - years_preferred: Number of years (null if not specified)
5. experience_range: Object with min_years and max_years (null if not specified)
6. responsibilities: Array of responsibility strings
7. qualifications: Array of qualification strings (education, certifications, etc.)
8. red_flags: Array of potential red flags to watch for (e.g., "No backend experience", "Job hopping")
9. evaluation_criteria: Array of objects with:
   - criterion: Name of the evaluation criterion
   - weight: Float between 0.0 and 1.0 (weights should sum to approximately 1.0)

Return the JSON matching this exact structure:
{{
  "role_title": "...",
  "department": "...",
  "seniority_level": "...",
  "required_skills": [
    {{"skill": "...", "priority": "must_have", "years_preferred": 3}},
    {{"skill": "...", "priority": "nice_to_have", "years_preferred": null}}
  ],
  "experience_range": {{"min_years": 4, "max_years": 8}},
  "responsibilities": ["...", "..."],
  "qualifications": ["...", "..."],
  "red_flags": ["...", "..."],
  "evaluation_criteria": [
    {{"criterion": "...", "weight": 0.25}},
    {{"criterion": "...", "weight": 0.20}}
  ]
}}

IMPORTANT: Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text.
